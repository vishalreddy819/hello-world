# hello-world
Just another repository
This is my 1st project. Making changes in rewme-edits branch.

Hi I and Linga Swamy is back.
public class HelloWorld {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Prints "Hello, World" in the terminal window.
      System.out.println("Hello, World");
   }
}
